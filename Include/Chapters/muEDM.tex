{\itshape
This chapter is an introduction to the muEDM experiment. After describing in some detail the spin dynamics, a reminder on the EDM searches for the different particles will follow.
We will then outline the measuring principle of the experiment, the frozen spin technique, and deep dive into the current status of the experiment. 
The study of systematic uncertainties and the upcoming schedule will close this chapter. 
As always, the early stage of the experiment means the rate of changes and improvement is outstanding. 
This is my attempt at an up-to-date description, which relies on the ``muEDM Status Report 2023'' submitted to PSI, but some details might be already outdated.}

\section{Electric Dipole Moment}
    As introduced in \ref{intro:edm}, the Hamiltonian describing the spin dynamics is:
    \begin{equation*}
        \hat{H} = -\mu\bm{\hat{\sigma}\cdot B}-d\bm{\hat{\sigma}\cdot E}
    \end{equation*}
    We then saw that, when considering a combination of magnetic and electric fields and a moving particle it is useful to introduce the polarization vector $\bm{\Pi}=\bm{s}/s$ and the Thomas precession $\bm{\Omega}_0$:
    \begin{equation*}
        \dv{\bm{\Pi}}{t}=\bm{\Omega}_0 \times \bm{\Pi}, \quad
        \bm{\Omega}_0 = -\frac{e}{m\gamma} \left[ (1+\gamma a)\bm{B}-\frac{a\gamma^2}{\gamma+1}(\bm{\beta}\cdot\bm{B})\bm{\beta}-\gamma \left( a+\frac{1}{\gamma+1} \right) \frac{\bm{\beta}\times \bm{E}}{c} \right]
    \end{equation*}
    With no electrical field parallel to the momentum and with $\bm{\Omega}_c$ the cyclotron frequency, the relative spin precession of a muon in a storage ring is described by (T-BMT \cite{miss-59}):
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{split}
            \bm{\Omega}=\bm{\Omega}_0-\bm{\Omega}_c &=
            \underbrace{ 
                \frac{q}{m}\left[ a\bm{B} -{\frac{a\gamma}{\gamma+1}(\bm{\beta}\cdot \bm{B})\bm{\beta}} - \left(  a+\frac{1}{1-\gamma^2}\right)\frac{\bm{\beta} \times \bm{E}}{c} \right]
            }_{\text{Anomalous precession, } \omega_a=\omega_L-\omega_c} \\&+
            \underbrace{
                \frac{\eta q}{2m}\left[ \bm{\beta} \times \bm{B} + \frac{\bm{E}}{c}- {\frac{\gamma c}{\gamma+1}(\bm{\beta}\cdot\bm{E\beta})} \right]
            }_{\text{Interaction of EDM and relativistic $\bm{E}$, } \omega_a}
        \end{split}
        \label{eq:muedm:precession}
    \end{equation}
    The second term describes the precession due to the \gls{edm} coupling to the relativistic $\bm{E}$, perpendicular to the $\bm{B}$ in which the particle is moving. 
    In the presence of a muon \gls{edm} the plane would be tilted and a vertical precession ($\bm{\omega}_e\perp\bm{B}$), shifted by $\pi/2$ to the horizontal anomalous precession, would become observable.

    \subsection{Symmetry violation}
        In physics, there are three cardinal discrete symmetries: Charge (C), Parity (P), and Time (T).
        P and T are related to the invariance under spatial and temporal reversal while C is the invariance for particle $\leftrightarrow$ \textit{anti}particle exchange.
        While the magnetic field and the spin are \textit{pseudo}-vectors under P and vectors under T, the electric field behaves in the opposite way.
        The implication of this difference is that EDM and MDM behave differently under C, P, and T:
        \begin{equation}
            MDM : 
            \begin{cases}
                \textbf{P} (-\mu\bm{\hat{\sigma}\cdot B}) = -\mu \bm{P(\hat{\sigma}) \cdot P(B)} = -\mu\bm{(+\hat{\sigma})\cdot (+B)} = -\mu\bm{\hat{\sigma}\cdot B} \\
                \textbf{T} (-\mu\bm{\hat{\sigma}\cdot B}) = -\mu \bm{T(\hat{\sigma}) \cdot T(B)} = -\mu\bm{(-\hat{\sigma})\cdot (-B)} = -\mu\bm{\hat{\sigma}\cdot B} 
            \end{cases}
        \end{equation}
        \begin{equation}
            EDM : 
            \begin{cases}
                \textbf{P} (-d\bm{\hat{\sigma}\cdot E}) = -d \bm{P(\hat{\sigma}) \cdot P(E)} = -d\bm{(+\hat{\sigma})\cdot (-E)} = +d\bm{\hat{\sigma}\cdot E} \\
                \textbf{T} (-d\bm{\hat{\sigma}\cdot E}) = -d \bm{T(\hat{\sigma}) \cdot T(E)} = -d\bm{(-\hat{\sigma})\cdot (+E)} = +d\bm{\hat{\sigma}\cdot E}          
            \end{cases}
        \end{equation}
        In light of the CPT theorem, the breaking of the T symmetry implies the breaking of CP.

    \subsection{Current limits on EDM}
        As discussed in \ref{sec:exp:edm}, the last decades saw a continuous effort to measure the EDM of different particles.
        There the experiments setting the current limits were discussed but we report in Tab.~\ref{tab:edm} the results to aid the reader.
        It is important to note there are two limits for $\upmu$: one obtained by rescaling the limit on $d_e$, obtaining an \textit{indirect limit}; one, less stringent, is a \textit{direct} limit ($^*$).

    \subsection{The \textit{frozen spin} technique}
        
        As illustrated in \cite{1,9}, with the appropriate choice of electric field and having $\bm{p}$, $\bm{B}$ and $\bm{E}$ forming an orthogonal basis, the anomalous precession term in eq. \ref{eq:muedm:precession} can be set to zero. 
        \begin{equation}
            a\bm{B}=\left( a-\frac{1}{\gamma^2-1} \right)\frac{\bm{\beta}\times\bm{E}}{c}
        \end{equation}
        In this situation the relative angle between $\bm{p}$ and spin remains unchanged if $\eta=0$, hence 'frozen'. 
        In the presence of an \gls{edm} the change in polarization would then follow
        \begin{equation}
            \label{eq:freezed}
            \dv{\bm{\Pi}}{t}=\bm{\omega}_e \times \bm{\Pi}, \quad
            \bm{\omega}_e=\frac{\eta q}{2m} \left(\bm{\beta}\times\bm{B}+\frac{\bm{E}_f}{c} \right) =
            \frac{2 d_\mu}{\hbar} \left(\bm{\beta}c\times\bm{B}+\bm{E}_f\right)
        \end{equation}
        The net result of the \gls{edm} is then a vertical build-up of the polarization given by Eq.~\ref{eq:edm:polarization} and illustrated by the sketch in Fig.~\ref{fig:muEDM:g-2_EDM}.
        \begin{equation}
            |\bm{\Pi}(t)|=P(t)=P_0\sin(\omega_e t)\approx P_0 \omega_e t \approx 2P_0\frac{d_\mu}{\hbar}\frac{E_f}{a\gamma^2}t
            \label{eq:edm:polarization}
        \end{equation}    
        The evaluation of the sensitivity will follow a brief introduction to the muEDM experiment, to better familiarize the reader with the system.

\section{The muEDM experiment}

\status{started}
\section{The precursor}
    The task at hand is quite complex and for this reason, the aim is to first have a working prototype to demonstrate the measuring principles, the achieved control on the different sources of uncertainties and the correct working of the different subdetectors.

    \subsection{Beam monitor}
    \subsection{TOF}
    \subsection{Injection}
    \subsection{Faraday rotator}
    
    \status{started}
    \subsection{Superconducting injection channel}
        To allow the incoming muons to enter the magnet without being reflected or deviated by fringing fields an injection channel is needed.
        For reasons that will be discussed in the section dedicated to the systematics (see Sec.~\ref{muEDM:systematics}), we will actually require two symmetrical injections.
        The idea is to use a superconducting pipe: the fields around the pipe will generate Eddy currents which will, in turn, generate an opposite field inside the pipe, canceling the first.
        Clearly, the development of such a system is not trivial, and a precise study of the different shapes and materials is required. 
        The hope would be to find a suitable \textit{high-temperature} superconductor.

        \paragraph{Prototypes}
        Three different concepts for SC-prototype shields are currently being investigated and tested. 
        The first concept employs high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tape\footnote{2G HTS wire, S-Innovations, 2011-2020} made of Yttrium barium copper oxide~(YBCO), with a high $T_{\rm c}$ of \SI{93}{K}, wound helically around a copper tube. The second prototype consists of Nb-Ti/Nb/Cu SC-sheets~\cite{Barna2018}, with a $T_{\rm c}$ of \SI{9.2}{K}, clamped around a hollow copper tube. 
        Lastly, the third prototype will be a combination of a commercial SC-tube Bi-2223\footnote{CAN-superconductors, 2023}, with an inner diameter of \SI{15}{mm}, and a $T_{\rm c}$ between \SIrange{105}{110}{K}, and a stack of discs made of rare-earth barium copper oxide (REBCO)\@. 
        This approach benefits from isotropically induced currents in the Bi-2223 tube, as well as persistent currents along the circular paths in the disks.
        Once the SC-prototypes are assembled, we will test them and compare the shielding factor to results from numerical models using the finite element method (COMSOL) to identify the most efficient configuration with the highest shielding factor. 

        \paragraph{First tests}
We are using a test setup made of a Helmholtz coil pair with a magnetic field strength of \SI{100}{mT} and a liquid nitrogen (LN\textsubscript{2}) bath maintained at \SI{77}{K} to evaluate the superconducting prototypes. The SC-prototype, under study, will be placed between the two coils and the whole system will be submerged into the cryogenic bath, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:Setup}.

\begin{figure}

    \label{fig:Setup}
\end{figure}

Initial measurements were performed on a prototype with a YBCO-tape, helically wound around a copper tube with an inner diameter of \SI{15}{mm} and a Bi-2223 sintered tube. Measurements of the magnetic field inside the prototypes were conducted using four Hall sensors\footnote{THS119 Hall Sensors, TOSHIBA Electronic Devises \& Storage Corporation, 2023}, distributed along a 3D-printed support inside the tube on four positions with a separation of \SI{24}{mm} between each of them. This setup enabled the measurement of the magnetic field as a function of position. The measurements were taken at \SI{77}{K}, with and without superconducting shielding, as illustrated in Figures~\ref{fig:YBCO} and~\ref{fig:Bi2223}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
		\subfloat[]{

    \label{fig:YBCO}
\end{figure}
%
%Comparing the plots in Figure \ref{fig:Plots}, we notice that the plateaus of the SC-shielded tube are curved with respect to the sharp plateaus of the tube without the SC-shielding. This indicates the presence of persistent currents flowing in the SC-shielded tube, counteracting the external magnetic field, and thus shows signs of superconductivity. After completing the measurement cycle, the current returns to \SI{0}{A}, but there is still remaining magnetic field inside the SC-tube. This indicates the presence of hysteresis effect, where persistent currents are still flowing inside the superconductor even when the magnetic field is removed. In future tests with better SC-tubes, a more dominant presence of persistent currents and hysteresis is expected as well as lower leaking magnetic flux densities.

    \subsection{Entrance detector} 
        After a muon successfully enters the experiment it would spiral to the other side of the magnet. 
        To store it a magnetic kick is necessary. 
        How to produce this kick is going to be discussed in the next section but in either case, this system needs to be triggered.
        To detect the muon entering the system a thin scintillator can be used.
        This needs to be thick enough to produce sufficient light but thin enough not to deflect the particle from the design orbit.
        With a dedicated \gf simulation\footnote{To be honest this was actually my first \gf project and \textit{few iterations} were needed.}, the amount of light exiting the different sides of the thin scintillator was studied as a function of the muon momentum. 
        The results of the simulations and the dedicated beamtimes to develop this entrance detector will be discussed in Ch.~\ref{ch:muEDM:entrance}, dedicated to this detector.

    \status{started}
    \subsection{Muon tracking}
    \label{sec:muEDM:gridpix:beamtime}
        Although during physics runs it is important to minimize the number of interactions of the muon along the path, it is a cardinal step to prove the muons are following the correct path and are properly stored.
        On top of this, the momentum difference between the CW and CCW injection needs to be below 0.5\%.
        For this reason, a removable muon-tracking device is under development.
        The proposed solution is a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) operated with an extremely light gas mixture based on helium, separated from the vacuum in the magnet bore by an extremely thin and vacuum-tight window (\SI{300}{\nano\meter} Silicon Nitride). 
        As a readout structure for this \tpc, the \grid detector is considered. 
        \grid is a gaseous detector made of a conductive mesh implanted \SI{50}{\micro\meter} above a Timepix chip~\cite{Llopart2007NIMA}.
        A voltage difference between the mesh and the chip produces an avalanche when drift electrons reach the mesh so that the \grid behaves like a sort of microscopic Micromegas.

        \paragraph{Beamtime}
        A prototype of this detector was developed a single GridPix and flushed with helium-isobutane gas mixtures. 
        It was tested in 2022 and the results have been published and can be found in \cite{muEDM:PSI:GridPix}.
        The setup was quite simple: the beam was centered through the TPC and scintillators were used as an external trigger.
        During this testing, the detector was tested at different pressures and voltages, and with different mixtures of gas.
        In Fig.~\ref{fig:gridpix_plateau} the trend of the detection efficiency of GridPix as a function of the mesh voltage is shown, demonstrating that the detector can be used with these kinds of mixtures with a wide efficiency plateau.

        \begin{figure}
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.5 \linewidth]{Figures/muEDM/gridpix_plateau.pdf}    
            \caption{Average number of reconstructed hits per track in the GridPix detector, as a function of mesh voltage, normalized to the asymptotic value of a sigmoid curve fitting the data points, for three different mixtures of helium-isobutane (95:5, 90:10, and 85:15).}
            \label{fig:gridpix_plateau}
        \end{figure}
        
        Following a successful beam test, simulation studies were conducted to evaluate the tracking capabilities of a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) designed for tracking \SI{28}{MeV/c} muons within the Phase~I magnet. 
        Two geometries were explored: a conventional longitudinal setup, where electrons drift along the $z$ axis parallel to the magnetic field, and an unconventional radial configuration, with electron drift in the $(x,y)$ plane. 
        Typically, TPC track resolution is highest in the direction orthogonal to the drift, favoring the longitudinal option for optimal momentum resolution, while the radial geometry excels in measuring muon entrance angles. 
        Despite assuming a detector pressure of \SI{400}{\milli\bar} in the simulations, the prevalence of multiple scattering effects diminishes the characteristic differences between the two geometries, making the resolution advantages less distinct.
        Achieving a momentum resolution surpassing \SI{0.3}{\percent} appears feasible, and the phase space resolutions seem adequate for alignment purposes. 
        In early 2024, a decision will be made regarding the TPC configuration, and the detector engineering will be finalized by year-end. 
        This encompasses the development of mechanical mockups for installing silicon nitride entrance windows with a thickness of \SI{300}{\nano\meter}. 
        On the detector front, tests are scheduled to experimentally validate the proposal to operate the detector at sub-atmospheric pressure, considering the anticipated very high ionization rates in the Phase~I experiment. 
        The design process will be complemented by thorough simulation studies aimed at optimizing the final configuration.
        
    \status{started}
    \subsection{Kicker}
        The prerequisite for the \textit{frozen spin} is to first store the muon around the design orbit.
        This is achieved by applying a longitudinal kick, canceling the momentum component parallel to the magnetic field.
        The development of this element is non-trivial because of the stringent requirements on the strength, time scale, and residual effects of the kick.
        A weakly focusing static field, produced by a circular coil, ensures confinement. 
        To compensate for muon acceleration upon entering the weakly focusing field, the pulsed field must be optimized to reduce longitudinal oscillations.
        The trigger signal for the magnet pulse, generated by an entrance detector (Sec.\ref{sec:MuInjTrigger}), selects muons within the storage phase space. 
        Considering processing delays, the \textit{on-demand} pulse generator must have an internal latency <$\SI{60}{ns}$.
        We started by looking into different shapes and types of coil as well as developing \ltsp simulations of the generating circuit.
        The current version of the circuit is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:muEDM:kicker:circuit}.
        
        The Institute for Pulsed Power and Microwave Technology at KIT developed high-voltage switching technology \cite{GateBoosting}, meeting current pulse specifications. 
        The generator, designed with a \SI{20}{\micro s} recovery time, can deliver up to 2000 pulses per second. 
        Pulse amplitude and shape are defined passively by load circuit impedance characteristics. 
        Lower inductance, achieved by splitting pulse coils into quadrants supplied in parallel, allows operation at \SI{12}{kV}, supporting the required pulse width and reducing voltage ratings of components and cables.

        \paragraph{Prototype}
        A \SI{100}{\micro m} copper sheet prototype for the quadrant pulse coil configuration (Fig.~\ref{fig:coils}(a)) was constructed, minimizing positron multiple scattering compared to \SI{500}{\micro m} thick plastic scintillating fibers. 
        The measured inductance per loop was \SI{76(3)}{nH}, in line with the ANSYS model prediction of \SI{79}{nH}.
        
        ANSYS-generated field maps (Fig.\ref{fig:coils}(c) and(d)) simulated the kick and characterized field strength and inductance. The quadrant model's geometry (Fig.\ref{fig:coils}(b)) with overlapping longitudinal sections led to partial cancellation due to opposite polarities. The DC magnetic field map in the central ($z=0$) $x-y$-plane is shown in(c), and plot~(d) displays the field along the orbit, parameterized by azimuthal angle $\phi$.
        
        The orange line at \SI{8.4}{\micro\tesla\per\ampere} in plot~(d) represents the average field strength over the orbit, falling $20\%$ below the expected strength for ideal circular loops. 
        Despite requiring a higher current for a given field strength, the quadrant model's advantage lies in the shorter pulse width allowed by low-inductance parallel circuits. 
        The compact design minimizes stray capacitance and inductance. 
        Supplying upstream and downstream segments in series within each quadrant ensures better longitudinal symmetry of the field, with equal current flow in both segments.

        \label{fig:coils}
        \end{figure}
        
        \paragraph{Generator}
        The pulse generator design, developed in collaboration with the KIT team, adheres to constraints from injection simulations and systematic effects studies. 
        Operating at \SI{12}{kV}, it delivers \SI{200}{A} to each coil quadrant. 
        Load characteristics, shaping the pulse, are defined based on prototype measurements and ANSYS simulations. 
        Inductive couplings between parallel circuits are determined from induced voltage measurements on the prototype.
        
        The current design, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:circuit} includes resistance-capacitive~(RC) damping elements on the coaxial cable, tuned to critically damp the primary pulse and suppress after-pulse oscillations. 
        This avoids perturbing the muon orbit or inducing time-dependent spin precession signals. 
        The pulse shape, influencing the applied momentum kick, is adjustable to maximize storage efficiency. 
        Simulated current profiles illustrate optimized damping for maximizing peak current and reducing after-pulse oscillations. 
        The voltage over the charging capacitor \textit{C1} demonstrates recovery within $1\%$ of the nominal operating voltage after a \SI{20}{\micro s} delay, meeting the desired interval between muon triggers.
        We plan to commission and test the pulse generator in mid-2024 for the upcoming beam test. 
        Pulse generator development is underway at KIT, with circuit parameters being finalized. Simultaneously, full load circuit characterization, utilizing a network analyzer, is ongoing to refine the ANSYS model of the quadrant configuration.

    \subsection{Frozen-spin electrodes}
        After the muon has been successfully stored around the design orbit the next step is to apply a radial electric field. 
        The strength of this field is going to modify the frequency of the g-2 precession, eventually \textit{freezing} the spin (eq. \ref{eq:freezed}) along the momentum direction.
        These electrodes need to be out of the muon orbit and with a minimal material budget to reduce the positron scattering.  
        Dedicated simulations and prototyping have been developed also for this element.\\\\

The radial electric field will be induced by concentric cylindrical electrodes at $r=\SI{40}{mm}$ (grounded) and $r=\SI{20}{mm}$ (high voltage), requiring $\sim\SI{6}{kV}$ to achieve a frozen-spin field strength of $\approx\SI{3}{kV\per cm}$ at the nominal orbit radius ($\rho=\SI{31}{mm}$).

A momentum bite of $0.5\%$ leads to a limit of approximately $1\%$ for matching the frozen-spin field strength over the momentum distribution, requiring a voltage precision better than $0.5\%$. To control systematic effects from a longitudinal electric field, the applied voltage stability must be constrained to $\sim10^{-4}$.

The 20HVA24-BP1-F high voltage amplifier by \textit{Advanced Energy}\footnote{\url{www.advancedenergy.com/en-us/products/dc-dc-conversion-products/high-voltage-boost-(u-v)/high-voltage-amplifiers/hva-series/}} meets these requirements with limited voltage ripple and a bipolar supply, enabling calibration of the frozen-spin field strength. This calibration involves observing spin precession due to the anomalous magnetic moment when the electric field is offset from $E_f$. The device will be tested with existing electrode prototypes to verify stability under applied high voltage in a vacuum, facilitating electric field measurements and geometric alignment. This progress informs the final electrode system design for integration in 2024, with further development leading to incorporation into anticipated beam tests in 2025.
Prototype electrodes, made from aluminized Kapton films, were designed to study eddy-currents induced by the magnetic field pulse. To minimize eddy currents, material with higher resistivity or optimized geometry is crucial. Measurement of the radial component at the muon orbit is necessary for shielding determination and design optimization.

Using a \SI{5}{mm} radius pickup coil, voltages induced by a \SI{10}{\mega\hertz} sinusoidal current in the pulse coils were compared for various electrode configurations. A ground electrode made from homogeneously aluminized Kapton exhibited a maximum shielding factor of $1.9(1)$, increasing to $3.0(2)$ with the HV electrode installed. However, azimuthal asymmetry along the muon orbit was observed due to the discontinuity at the gluing seam.

A new prototype with aluminum distributed in \SI{2}{mm} stripes (\SI{2.2}{mm} pitch) was prepared. Measurements with this segmented electrode showed shielding factors $<1.1$ ($90\%$ C.L.), indicating effective restriction of radial eddy-current flow across length scales comparable to the coils. This allows near-complete transmission of the radial field at frequencies relevant to the magnetic field pulse (Sec.~\ref{sec:B_FieldPulse}), with no measurable shielding or azimuthal asymmetry.

Noting that a segmented electrode introduces periodic field non-uniformity along the orbit, investigations were conducted to explore possible systematic effects arising from the accumulation of a geometric phase. For instance, separating the electrodes into 100 longitudinal strands would induce $E$-field oscillations of approximately \SI{40}{\giga\hertz}.

Implemented in ANSYS with 60 wires of \SI{1}{mm} diameter for the high voltage electrode and 120 for the ground (Fig.~\ref{fig:segmented}(b)), the transverse cross-section of the electric field shows negligible high-frequency oscillations for a displaced orbit (\SI{6}{mm}). The study demonstrates that a segmented electrode will not introduce additional systematic effects.

The dashed vertical lines indicate the radial offset due to changes in momentum $\pm0.5\%$. The dashed curves indicate the electric field which would satisfy the frozen-spin condition for these shifted momenta and radii. The resultant discrepancy is $\sim1\%$, limiting the precision necessary for the electric field strength given a momentum bite of $0.5\%$.}

    \subsection{Positron tracking}
        The development of the positron tracker has been a big part of my work in the collaboration.
        For this reason, an in-depth description will follow in a dedicated chapter (see Ch.~\ref{ch:muEDM:tracker}) while here we will just outline the basic idea.
        The project started with a `two subsystems' approach:
        \begin{outline}
            \1 A silicon pixel external tracker will be used to track precisely the transverse position of the positron. 
            This sub-detector aims to measure the g-2 precession to fine-tune the radial electric field to achieve the frozen-spin condition.
            A straw-tube-based alternative design for this sub-detector as also been studied but later discarded.
            \1 An internal scintillating fiber detector (with comparable resolution on the transverse position) will complement the silicon pixel with additional hits. 
            The requirement is to have a better resolution on the longitudinal position of the hits to measure the EDM by looking at the pitch of the outgoing helical track.
            I dedicated most of my effort to this sub-detector.
        \end{outline}
        Unfortunately, the development of the Pixel detector met some complications and we will rely exclusively on the scintillating fibers during Phase I, prompting a review of the whole detector design.  

\status{review}
\section{Sensitivity}
\label{muEDM:sensitivity}
    If the muon spin has a component parallel to the main magnetic field, the difference in probability $p$ for positron emission along ($p_\uparrow$) or opposite ($p_\downarrow$) the magnetic field will generate an asymmetry
    \begin{equation}
        A = \frac{p_\uparrow - p_\downarrow}{p_\uparrow + p_\downarrow}
    \label{eq:asym_theory}
    \end{equation}        
    For an EDM-induced spin precession, the observable is the time derivative of $A$.
    The variables $p_\uparrow$ and $p_\downarrow$ are the result of the angular distribution of Michel decay positrons
    \begin{equation}
        W(x, y)dxdy = x^2 \left((3-2x) + (2x - 1)y\right)dxdy,
    \end{equation}
    where $x = E/E_\mathrm{max}$, and $y = \lvert \vec p_\mu \cdot \vec p_e \rvert$ is the angle between the momenta of the muon and decay positron. 
    We can express the non-boosted variables in terms of the boosted ones, such as
    \begin{equation}
	u = \frac{E'}{E'_\mathrm{max}} = x\frac{\sqrt{\gamma^2 (y+\beta)^2 + 1 - y^2}}{\gamma(1+\beta)},\quad
	v = \cos\left(\arctan\frac{E'_x}{E'_z}\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(E'_x/E'_z)^2 + 1}}.
    \end{equation}
    Expressing non-boosted variables with these, and with some manipulation, we obtain the boosted energy spectrum $N(u)$, the asymmetry $A(u, v)$, and its rate of change $\partial_\Psi A$ with respect to the polar angle $\Psi$ of the spin.
    For details, see \cite{chavdar:2023}.
    These variables are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:n_dot_a} for phases I and II.
    \noindent
    The aim is then to optimize the sensitivity by applying a selection of positron energies and emission angles at the cost of statistics. Therefore, we optimize the sensitivity to $d_\mu$: $\sigma(d_\mu) \sim 1/(\alpha\sqrt{N})$ and define the figure of merit, where $N_{e^+}$ is the number of detected decay positrons, $N_{\mu^+}$ is the total number of muons stored, and $\tilde\alpha$ is the weighted average of the rate of change of the parity-violating decay asymmetry. 

    \begin{equation}
	F = \tilde\alpha \sqrt{\frac{N_{e^+}}{N_{\mu^+}}}; \ 
    \tilde\alpha = \frac{1}{N_{\mu^+}} \int \partial_\Psi A(u) N(u)
	du,
	\label{eq:figure_of_merit}
    \end{equation}

    At this point, we have a few options:
    \begin{outline}
        \1[A] The first option is to count all positrons, independently of the emission variables. This leads to $F=\tilde\alpha \approx 0.166$ for both phases I and II
        \1[T] The second option is to count only positrons above a given fractional energy $u_0$. For the two phases, maximizing the figure of merit results in 0.22 for $u_0\approx0.60$ and 0.17 for $u_0=0.18$
        \1[W] Last option is to define emission angle and/or fractional energy bins. 
        For each bin $(u, \theta, \phi)$ we can define a figure of merit $W_{ijk} = \alpha_{ijk} \sqrt{N_{ijk}}$, with $N_{ijk}$ as integral of $ N(u, \theta, \phi)$ on the $ijk$ bin, and $\alpha_{ijk}$ the integral of $ \partial_\Psi A(u,
	\theta, \phi) N(u, \theta, \phi) / N_{ijk}$.\\
        The resulting figure of merit is then $\mathcal{W} =  \sqrt{\sum_{ijk} W_{ijk}^2}$ and it's maximum is $\approx0.29$.
        On a practical level, it depends on the reconstruction in the different bins and is evaluated as:
        $$W^2_{ijk} = \frac{(N_\uparrow - N_\downarrow)^2}{N_\uparrow + N_\downarrow},\text{ and }  \dot A_{ijk} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{N_\uparrow - N_\downarrow}{N_\uparrow + N_\downarrow} \right)$$
    \end{outline}
    All these values are illustrated in Tab.~\ref{tab:AnalysisMethods}. 
    The key aspects are clearly shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:n_dot_a} and here summarized.
    In Phase I, the impact of positrons with energy below \SI{27.6}{MeV} on measurement asymmetry is negligible. 
    Optimal sensitivity is achieved when considering positrons within an opening angle range of \SI{30}{\degree} to \SI{90}{\degree}, provided their energy exceeds \SI{41}{MeV}. 
    For Phase II, valuable asymmetry information is present in emission angles up to \SI{135}{\degree} and energies surpassing \SI{21}{MeV}.

The spectrum is divided into two to improve the visibility of the plot.

\section{Systematics}
\label{muEDM:systematics}
    Like for the majority of the experiment at the edge of our current understanding, the systematic effects play a key role.
    Most of the studies on this topic were performed by Chavdar Dustov, Post Doc at PSI. 
    The key aspects have been compiled in a recent publication \cite{chavdar:2023}, on which this section relies. 
    For the precursor and final experiment, the expected angular velocity of the spin induced by the EDM is here evaluated. These values give us a benchmark for the systematic effects.
    \begin{equation*}
        \dot{\Pi} = 
        \begin{cases}
            \SI{21.15}{\micro rad \per \micro s};&\text{for $\beta=0.26$ and $d_\upmu=\SI{3e-21}{e cm}$} \\
            \SI{1.26}{\micro rad \per \micro s};&\text{for $\beta=0.77$ and $d_\upmu=\SI{6e-23}{e cm}$}

    \subsection{Possible sources of spin precessions}
    We will now outline different sources of possible spin precession. 
    From each of these sources, a limit on a specific aspect of the experiment was extracted. 
    
        \paragraph{Radial} If the particle stays at a constant radius, the coupling of the MDM with the radial component of the weakly focusing field generates a precession.
        A similar effect arises from the non-zero longitudinal electric field. This component, seen from the muon reference frame, corresponds to a radial magnetic field and also leads to a radial precession.

        \paragraph{Azimuthal} When stored in the equilibrium orbit the muons oscillate. Because of this oscillation, the momentum is not perfectly perpendicular to the longitudinal magnetic field. 
        This produces a non-zero projection of the magnetic field along the trajectory.
        On top of this, if the radial electric field is not \textit{exactly} set to the value required to freeze the spin, it will interact with the longitudinal momentum of the particle.
        
        \paragraph{$\bm{E}$ imperfections} Another source of precession can be the change of the electric field along the orbit.
        This can be the case if the axes of the magnetic field and electric fields are displaced or at an angle.
        The effect of such imperfections can be mitigated by developing two injection channels and inverting the $B$ field, obtaining `specular' trajectories (CW and CCW).
        Just like for the other sources, we will omit the calculations, which can be found in the reference \cite{chavdar:2023}. 
        In these effects, is important to consider the cylindrical symmetry of the problem and evaluate the effects averaged over the circular orbit.
        In the next order, the deviations from circular to distorted orbits are also an interesting exercise, although the approximation holds quite well.

        \paragraph{Apparent spin precession} As already discussed, a longitudinal component of the spin produces an asymmetry. 
        This asymmetry changes in time because of the coupling of the spin with the EM fields. 
        What is measured is this rate of change of the asymmetry.
        The number of observed particles in a direction will be $N_\uparrow = \Omega_\uparrow\varepsilon_\uparrow p_\uparrow N_{\mu^+} =  \kappa_\uparrow p_\uparrow N_{\mu^+}$, where $\kappa$ takes into account the acceptance and efficiency of the detector, while $p$ is the probability and $N_{\mu^+}$ the number of stopped muons.
        \begin{equation}
            A_m = \frac{1}{N_{\mu^+}} \left( \frac{n_\uparrow}{\kappa_\uparrow} - \frac{n_\downarrow}{\kappa_\downarrow} \right)
        \end{equation}
        This equation highlights why a requirement on the temporal stability of the detectors is necessary to avoid detecting apparent asymmetry.

    \status{review}
    \subsection{Comparison with \gf}
        The analytical part of this study has two types of parameters: 8 stochastic, defining the initial condition of every stored particle, and 10 constant/slowly changing parameters of the experimental setup. 
        To verify the results of the analytical mode, a \gf simulation was developed.
        In this simulation, the EM fields can be calculated or interpolated from ANSYS field maps.
        The simulation tracks the spin orientation in the muon and in the laboratory reference frame, which can be then compared with the analytic results.
        The example in Fig.~\ref{fig:muEDM:systematics} shows very good agreement.

    \status{review}
    \subsection{Constraits} 
        To extract from each aspect a constraint on the variables at play in the experiment is not an easy task.
        Although we highlighted some key sources of real/apparent spin precession, we will not delve into the evaluation of the actual constraints and the way they can be extracted, which is partially described in \cite{chavdar:2023}.
        An example of the plot showing this type of study is in Fig.~\ref{fig:muEDM:systematics}, in which the measured `false' EDM is shown as a function of the longitudinal E field and $\beta$ of the muons.
        The introduction of the CW and CCW injection brings us to the plot in Fig.~\ref{fig:muEDM:omz_ez_limit}.
        The summary of the current understanding of the systematics is shown in Tab.~\ref{tab:SystematicEffects}.
        Fo each entry of this table plots similar to Fig.~\ref{fig:muEDM:systematics} or Fig.~\ref{fig:muEDM:omz_ez_limit} have been used, but we will not include them.

\section{Schedule}
    As we just saw, although the development of the precursor is moving at a very nice speed, the tasks are very challenging.
    To put in perspective the current understanding of the different challenges and time constraints, we add here the schedule that was included in the proposal of the experiment in 2022.
    Fig.~\ref{fig:muEDM:schedule:short} is a schedule on the short period up to the long shut-down, in which 6 main milestones are highlighted:
    \begin{outline}
        \1[1] Demonstration of off-axis injection
        \1[2] Muon selection and generation of trigger
        \1[3] Generation of the pulsed magnetic field and measurement of eddy-currents
        \1[4] Stopping of muons and detection of $(g - 2)$ precession
        \1[5] Adjusting the electric field by tuning $(g - 2)$ precession to zero
        \1[6] Data-taking in muon EDM mode
    \end{outline}
    Fig.~\ref{fig:muEDM:schedule:long} goes beyond the long shut-down and covers the full life of the experiment, up to 2033.

\section{Conclusions}
    After reviewing the concept of EDM, the current limits, and the frozen spin technique, we described the MuEDM experiment.
    A description of the different subsistem and their current status was given, leaving the muon detection and the positron tracking for the Ch.~\ref{ch:muEDM:entrance} and Ch.~\ref{ch:muEDM:tracker}.
    A status on the study of the systematics and a brief section on the upcoming schedule end the chapter.
    The experiment is still in an early phase but a lot of progress has been made during the last 2/3 years.
