{\itshape
This chapter is an introduction to the muEDM experiment. After describing in some detail the spin dynamics, a reminder on the EDM searches for the different particles will follow.
We will then outline the measuring principle of the experiment, the frozen spin technique, and deep dive into the current status of the experiment. 
The study of systematic uncertainties will close this chapter. 
As always, the early stage of the experiment means the rate of changes and improvement is outstanding. 
This my attempt to an up-to-date description but some details might be already outdated.}

\section{Electric Dipole Moment}
    As introduced in \ref{intro:edm}, the Hamiltonian describing the spin dynamics is:
    \begin{equation*}
        \hat{H} = -\mu\bm{\hat{\sigma}\cdot B}-d\bm{\hat{\sigma}\cdot E}
    \end{equation*}
    We then saw that, when considering a combination of magnetic and electric fields and a moving particle it is useful to introduce the polarization vector $\bm{\Pi}=\bm{s}/s$ and the Thomas precession $\bm{\Omega}_0$:
    \begin{equation*}
        \dv{\bm{\Pi}}{t}=\bm{\Omega}_0 \times \bm{\Pi}, \quad
        \bm{\Omega}_0 = -\frac{e}{m\gamma} \left[ (1+\gamma a)\bm{B}-\frac{a\gamma^2}{\gamma+1}(\bm{\beta}\cdot\bm{B})\bm{\beta}-\gamma \left( a+\frac{1}{\gamma+1} \right) \frac{\bm{\beta}\times \bm{E}}{c} \right]
    \end{equation*}
    With no electrical field parallel to the momentum and with $\bm{\Omega}_c$ the cyclotron frequency, the relative spin precession of a muon in a storage ring is described by (T-BMT \cite{miss-59}):
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{split}
            \bm{\Omega}=\bm{\Omega}_0-\bm{\Omega}_c &=
            \underbrace{ 
                \frac{q}{m}\left[ a\bm{B} -{\frac{a\gamma}{\gamma+1}(\bm{\beta}\cdot \bm{B})\bm{\beta}} - \left(  a+\frac{1}{1-\gamma^2}\right)\frac{\bm{\beta} \times \bm{E}}{c} \right]
            }_{\text{Anomalous precession, } \omega_a=\omega_L-\omega_c} \\&+
            \underbrace{
                \frac{\eta q}{2m}\left[ \bm{\beta} \times \bm{B} + \frac{\bm{E}}{c}- {\frac{\gamma c}{\gamma+1}(\bm{\beta}\cdot\bm{E\beta})} \right]
            }_{\text{Interaction of EDM and relativistic $\bm{E}$, } \omega_a}
        \end{split}
        \label{eq:muedm:precession}
    \end{equation}
    The second term describes the precession due to the \gls{edm} coupling to the relativistic $\bm{E}$, perpendicular to the $\bm{B}$ in which the particle is moving. 
    In the presence of a muon \gls{edm} the plane would be tilted and a vertical precession ($\bm{\omega}_e\perp\bm{B}$), shifted by $\pi/2$ to the horizontal anomalous precession, would become observable.

    \subsection{Symmetry violation}
        In physics, there are three cardinal discrete symmetries: Charge (C), Parity (P), and Time (T).
        P and T are related to the invariance under spatial and temporal reversal while C is the invariance for particle $\leftrightarrow$ \textit{anti}particle exchange.
        While the magnetic field and the spin are \textit{pseudo}-vectors under P and vectors under T, the electric field behaves in the opposite way.
        The implication of this difference is that EDM and MDM behave differently under C, P, and T:
        \begin{equation}
            MDM : 
            \begin{cases}
                \textbf{P} (-\mu\bm{\hat{\sigma}\cdot B}) = -\mu \bm{P(\hat{\sigma}) \cdot P(B)} = -\mu\bm{(+\hat{\sigma})\cdot (+B)} = -\mu\bm{\hat{\sigma}\cdot B} \\
                \textbf{T} (-\mu\bm{\hat{\sigma}\cdot B}) = -\mu \bm{T(\hat{\sigma}) \cdot T(B)} = -\mu\bm{(-\hat{\sigma})\cdot (-B)} = -\mu\bm{\hat{\sigma}\cdot B} 
            \end{cases}
        \end{equation}
        \begin{equation}
            EDM : 
            \begin{cases}
                \textbf{P} (-d\bm{\hat{\sigma}\cdot E}) = -d \bm{P(\hat{\sigma}) \cdot P(E)} = -d\bm{(+\hat{\sigma})\cdot (-E)} = +d\bm{\hat{\sigma}\cdot E} \\
                \textbf{T} (-d\bm{\hat{\sigma}\cdot E}) = -d \bm{T(\hat{\sigma}) \cdot T(E)} = -d\bm{(-\hat{\sigma})\cdot (+E)} = +d\bm{\hat{\sigma}\cdot E}          
            \end{cases}
        \end{equation}
        In light of the CPT theorem, the breaking of the T symmetry implies the breaking of CP.

    \subsection{Current limits on EDM}
        As discussed in \ref{sec:exp:edm}, the last decades saw a continuous effort to measure the EDM of different particles.
        There the experiments setting the current limits were discussed but we report in Tab.~\ref{tab:edm} the results to aid the reader.
        It is important to note there are two limits for $\upmu$: one obtained by rescaling the limit on $d_e$, obtaining an \textit{indirect limit}; one, less stringent, is a \textit{direct} limit ($^*$).

    \subsection{The \textit{frozen spin} technique}
        
        As illustrated in \cite{1,9}, with the appropriate choice of electric field and having $\bm{p}$, $\bm{B}$ and $\bm{E}$ forming an orthogonal basis, the anomalous precession term in eq. \ref{eq:muedm:precession} can be set to zero. 
        \begin{equation}
            a\bm{B}=\left( a-\frac{1}{\gamma^2-1} \right)\frac{\bm{\beta}\times\bm{E}}{c}
        \end{equation}
        In this situation the relative angle between $\bm{p}$ and spin remains unchanged if $\eta=0$, hence 'frozen'. 
        In the presence of an \gls{edm} the change in polarization would then follow
        \begin{equation}
            \label{eq:freezed}
            \dv{\bm{\Pi}}{t}=\bm{\omega}_e \times \bm{\Pi}, \quad
            \bm{\omega}_e=\frac{\eta q}{2m} \left(\bm{\beta}\times\bm{B}+\frac{\bm{E}_f}{c} \right) =
            \frac{2 d_\mu}{\hbar} \left(\bm{\beta}c\times\bm{B}+\bm{E}_f\right)
        \end{equation}
        The net result of the \gls{edm} is then a vertical build-up of the polarization given by Eq.~\ref{eq:edm:polarization} and illustrated by the sketch in Fig.~\ref{fig:muEDM:g-2_EDM}.
        \begin{equation}
            |\bm{\Pi}(t)|=P(t)=P_0\sin(\omega_e t)\approx P_0 \omega_e t \approx 2P_0\frac{d_\mu}{\hbar}\frac{E_f}{a\gamma^2}t
            \label{eq:edm:polarization}
        \end{equation}    
        The evaluation of the sensitivity will follow a brief introduction to the muEDM experiment, to better familiarize the reader with the system.

\section{The muEDM experiment}

\status{started}
\section{The precursor}
    The task at hand is quite complex and for this reason, the aim is to first have a working prototype to demonstrate the measuring principles, the achieved control on the different sources of uncertainties and the correct working of the different subdetectors.
    
    \status{started}
    \subsection{Superconducting injection channel}
        To allow the incoming muons to enter the magnet without being reflected or deviated by fringing fields an injection channel is needed.
        For reasons that will be discussed in the section dedicated to the systematics (see Sec.~\ref{muEDM:systematics}), we will actually require two symmetrical injections.
        The idea is to use a superconducting pipe: the fields around the pipe will generate Eddy currents which will, in turn, generate an opposite field inside the pipe, canceling the first.
        Clearly, the development of such a system is not trivial, and a precise study of the different shapes and materials is required. 
        The hope would be to find a suitable \textit{high-temperature} superconductor.

    \status{review}
    \subsection{Entrance detector} 
        After a muon successfully enters the experiment it would spiral to the other side of the magnet. 
        To store it a magnetic kick is necessary. 
        How to produce this kick is going to be discussed in the next section but in either case, this system needs to be triggered.
        To detect the muon entering the system a thin scintillator can be used.
        This needs to be thick enough to produce sufficient light but thin enough not to deflect the particle from the design orbit.
        With a dedicated \gf simulation\footnote{To be honest this was actually my first \gf project and \textit{few iterations} were needed.}, the amount of light exiting the different sides of the thin scintillator was studied as a function of the muon momentum. 
        The results of the simulations and the dedicated beamtimes to develop this entrance detector will be discussed in Ch.~\ref{ch:muEDM:entrance}, dedicated to this detector.

    \status{started}
    \subsection{Muon tracking}
    \label{sec:muEDM:gridpix:beamtime}
        Although during physics runs it is important to minimize the number of interactions of the muon along the path, it is a cardinal step to prove the muons are following the correct path.
        For this reason, a removable muon-tracking device is under development.
        The idea is to use \tpc + \grid.

        \paragraph{Beamtime}
        A prototype of this detector was developed and tested in 2022, the results have been published and can be found in \cite{muEDM:PSI:GridPix}.
        The setup was quite simple: the beam was centered through the TPC and scintillators were used as an external trigger.
        During this testing, the detector was tested at different pressures and voltages, and with different mixtures of gas.
    \status{started}
    \subsection{Kicker}
        The prerequisite for the \textit{frozen spin} is to first store the muon around the design orbit.
        This is achieved by applying a longitudinal kick, canceling the momentum component parallel to the magnetic field.
        The development of this element is non-trivial because of the stringent requirements on the strength, time scale, and residual effects of the kick.
        We started by looking into different shapes and types of coil as well as developing \ltsp simulations of the generating circuit.
        The current version of the circuit is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:muEDM:kicker:circuit}.
        
        \begin{figure}
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{Figures/muEDM/CircuitMuonKickerV3_1.png}
            \caption{\ltsp simulation for the kicker circuit.}
            \label{fig:muEDM:kicker:circuit}
        \end{figure}

    \status{started}
    \subsection{Electrodes}
        After the muon has been successfully stored around the design orbit the next step is to apply a radial electric field. 
        The strength of this field is going to modify the frequency of the g-2 precession, eventually \textit{freezing} the spin (eq. \ref{eq:freezed}) along the momentum direction.
        These electrodes need to be out of the muon orbit and with a minimal material budget to reduce the positron scattering.  
        Dedicated simulations and prototyping have been developed also for this element.

    \status{review}
    \subsection{Positron tracking}
        The development of the positron tracker has been a big part of my work in the collaboration.
        For this reason, an in-depth description will follow in a dedicated chapter (see Ch.~\ref{ch:muEDM:tracker}) while here we will just outline the basic idea.
        The project started with a `two subsystems' approach:
        \begin{outline}
            \1 A silicon pixel external tracker will be used to track precisely the transverse position of the positron. 
            This sub-detector aims to measure the g-2 precession to fine-tune the radial electric field to achieve the frozen-spin condition.
            A straw-tube-based alternative design for this sub-detector as also been studied but later discarded.
            \1 An internal scintillating fiber detector (with comparable resolution on the transverse position) will complement the silicon pixel with additional hits. 
            The requirement is to have a better resolution on the longitudinal position of the hits to measure the EDM by looking at the pitch of the outgoing helical track.
            I dedicated most of my effort to this sub-detector.
        \end{outline}
        Unfortunately, the development of the Pixel detector met some complications and we will rely exclusively on the scintillating fibers during Phase I, prompting a review of the whole detector design.  

\status{review}
\section{Sensitivity}
\label{muEDM:sensitivity}
    If the muon spin has a component parallel to the main magnetic field, the difference in probability $p$ for positron emission along ($p_\uparrow$) or opposite ($p_\downarrow$) the magnetic field will generate an asymmetry
    \begin{equation}
        A = \frac{p_\uparrow - p_\downarrow}{p_\uparrow + p_\downarrow}
    \label{eq:asym_theory}
    \end{equation}        
    For an EDM-induced spin precession, the observable is the time derivative of $A$.
    The variables $p_\uparrow$ and $p_\downarrow$ are the result of the angular distribution of Michel decay positrons
    \begin{equation}
        W(x, y)dxdy = x^2 \left((3-2x) + (2x - 1)y\right)dxdy,
    \end{equation}
    where $x = E/E_\mathrm{max}$, and $y = \lvert \vec p_\mu \cdot \vec p_e \rvert$ is the angle between the momenta of the muon and decay positron. 
    We can express the non-boosted variables in terms of the boosted ones, such as
    \begin{equation}
	u = \frac{E'}{E'_\mathrm{max}} = x\frac{\sqrt{\gamma^2 (y+\beta)^2 + 1 - y^2}}{\gamma(1+\beta)},\quad
	v = \cos\left(\arctan\frac{E'_x}{E'_z}\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(E'_x/E'_z)^2 + 1}}.
    \end{equation}
    Expressing non-boosted variables with these, and with some manipulation, we obtain the boosted energy spectrum $N(u)$, the asymmetry $A(u, v)$, and its rate of change $\partial_\Psi A$ with respect to the polar angle $\Psi$ of the spin.
    For details, see \cite{chavdar:2023}.
    These variables are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:n_dot_a} for phases I and II.
    \noindent
    The aim is then to optimize the sensitivity by applying a selection of positron energies and emission angles at the cost of statistics. Therefore, we optimize the sensitivity to $d_\mu$: $\sigma(d_\mu) \sim 1/(\alpha\sqrt{N})$ and define the figure of merit, where $N_{e^+}$ is the number of detected decay positrons, $N_{\mu^+}$ is the total number of muons stored, and $\tilde\alpha$ is the weighted average of the rate of change of the parity-violating decay asymmetry. 

    \begin{equation}
	F = \tilde\alpha \sqrt{\frac{N_{e^+}}{N_{\mu^+}}}; \ 
    \tilde\alpha = \frac{1}{N_{\mu^+}} \int \partial_\Psi A(u) N(u)
	du,
	\label{eq:figure_of_merit}
    \end{equation}

    At this point, we have a few options:
    \begin{outline}
        \1[A] The first option is to count all positrons, independently of the emission variables. This leads to $F=\tilde\alpha \approx 0.166$ for both phases I and II
        \1[T] The second option is to count only positrons above a given fractional energy $u_0$. For the two phases, maximizing the figure of merit results in 0.22 for $u_0\approx0.60$ and 0.17 for $u_0=0.18$
        \1[W] Last option is to define emission angle and/or fractional energy bins. 
        For each bin $(u, \theta, \phi)$ we can define a figure of merit $W_{ijk} = \alpha_{ijk} \sqrt{N_{ijk}}$, with $N_{ijk}$ as integral of $ N(u, \theta, \phi)$ on the $ijk$ bin, and $\alpha_{ijk}$ the integral of $ \partial_\Psi A(u,
	\theta, \phi) N(u, \theta, \phi) / N_{ijk}$.\\
        The resulting figure of merit is then $\mathcal{W} =  \sqrt{\sum_{ijk} W_{ijk}^2}$ and it's maximum is $\approx0.29$.
        On a practical level, it depends on the reconstruction in the different bins and is evaluated as:
        $$W^2_{ijk} = \frac{(N_\uparrow - N_\downarrow)^2}{N_\uparrow + N_\downarrow},\text{ and }  \dot A_{ijk} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{N_\uparrow - N_\downarrow}{N_\uparrow + N_\downarrow} \right)$$
    \end{outline}
    All these values are illustrated in Tab.~\ref{tab:AnalysisMethods}. 
    The key aspects are clearly shown in Fig.~\ref{} and here sumarized.
    In the Phase I, the impact of positrons with an energy below \SI{27.6}{MeV} on measurement asymmetry is negligible. 
    Optimal sensitivity is achieved when considering positrons within an opening angle range of \SI{30}{\degree} to \SI{90}{\degree}, provided their energy exceeds \SI{41}{MeV}. 
    For PhaseII, valuable asymmetry information is present in emission angles up to \SI{135}{\degree} and energies surpassing \SI{21}{MeV}.

\section{Systematics}
\label{muEDM:systematics}
    Like for the majority of the experiment at the edge of our current understanding, the systematic effects play a key role.
    Most of the studies on this topic were performed by Chavdar Dustov, Post Doc at PSI. 
    The key aspects have been compiled in a recent publication \cite{chavdar:2023}, on which this section relies. 
    For the precursor and final experiment, the expected angular velocity of the spin induced by the EDM is here evaluated. These values give us a benchmark for the systematic effects.
    \begin{equation*}
        \dot{\Pi} = 
        \begin{cases}
            \SI{21.15}{\micro rad \per \micro s};&\text{for $\beta=0.26$ and $d_\upmu=\SI{3e-21}{e cm}$} \\

    \subsection{Possible sources of spin precessions}
    We will now outline different sources of possible spin precession. 
    From each of these sources, a limit on a specific aspect of the experiment was extracted. 
    
        \paragraph{Radial} If the particle stays at a constant radius, the coupling of the MDM with the radial component of the weakly focusing field generates a precession.
        A similar effect arises from the non-zero longitudinal electric field. This component, seen from the muon reference frame, corresponds to a radial magnetic field and also leads to a radial precession.

        \paragraph{Azimuthal} When stored in the equilibrium orbit the muons oscillate. Because of this oscillation, the momentum is not perfectly perpendicular to the longitudinal magnetic field. 
        This produces a non-zero projection of the magnetic field along the trajectory.
        On top of this, if the radial electric field is not \textit{exactly} set to the value required to freeze the spin, it will interact with the longitudinal momentum of the particle.
        
        \paragraph{$\bm{E}$ imperfections} Another source of precession can be the change of the electric field along the orbit.
        This can be the case if the axes of the magnetic field and electric fields are displaced or at an angle.
        Just like for the other sources, we will omit the calculations, which can be found in the reference \cite{chavdar:2023}. 
        In these effects, is important to consider the cylindrical symmetry of the problem and evaluate the effects averaged over the circular orbit.
        In the next order, the deviations from circular to distorted orbits are also an interesting exercise, although the approximation holds quite well.

        \paragraph{Apparent spin precession} As already discussed, a longitudinal component of the spin produces an asymmetry. 
        This asymmetry changes in time because of the coupling of the spin with the EM fields. 
        What is measured is this rate of change of the asymmetry.
        The number of observed particles in a direction will be $N_\uparrow = \Omega_\uparrow\varepsilon_\uparrow p_\uparrow N_{\mu^+} =  \kappa_\uparrow p_\uparrow N_{\mu^+}$, where $\kappa$ takes into account the acceptance and efficiency of the detector, while $p$ is the probability and $N_{\mu^+}$ the number of stopped muons.
        \begin{equation}
            A_m = \frac{1}{N_{\mu^+}} \left( \frac{n_\uparrow}{\kappa_\uparrow} - \frac{n_\downarrow}{\kappa_\downarrow} \right)
        \end{equation}
        This equation highlights why a requirement on the temporal stability of the detectors is necessary to avoid detecting apparent asymmetry.

    \subsection{Comparison with \gf}
        The analytical part of this study has two types of parameters: 8 stochastic, defining the initial condition of every stored particle, and 10 constant/slowly changing parameters of the experimental setup. 
        To verify the results of the analytical mode, a \gf simulation was developed.
        In this simulation, the EM fields can be calculated or interpolated from ANSYS field maps.
        The simulation tracks the spin orientation in the muon and in the laboratory reference frame, which can be then compared with the analytic results.
        The example in Fig.~\ref{fig:muEDM:systematics} shows very good agreement.

\section{Schedule}
    As we just saw, although the development of the precursor is moving at a very nice speed, the tasks are very challenging.
    To put in perspective the current understanding of the different challenges and time constraints, we add here the schedule that was included in the proposal of the experiment in 2022.
    Fig.~\ref{fig:muEDM:schedule:short} is a schedule on the short period up to the long shut-down, in which 6 main milestones are highlighted:
    \begin{outline}
        \1[1] Demonstration of off-axis injection
        \1[2] Muon selection and generation of trigger
        \1[3] Generation of the pulsed magnetic field and measurement of eddy-currents
        \1[4] Stopping of muons and detection of $(g - 2)$ precession
        \1[5] Adjusting the electric field by tuning $(g - 2)$ precession to zero
        \1[6] Data-taking in muon EDM mode
    \end{outline}
    Fig.~\ref{fig:muEDM:schedule:long} goes beyond the long shut-down and covers the full life of the experiment, up to 2033.
