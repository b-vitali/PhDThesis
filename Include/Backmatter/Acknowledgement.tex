\section*{Acknowledgements}
There have been three types of relations helping me reaching this point in my life: relatives have been a steady pillar from which I could reach out to the unknown; mentors showed me a path, leaving me the leisure of choosing if/when/how take it; friends shared with me tears and laughter along the road.
None of you reading these few lines has been fixed in one of these roles and I am grateful to you from the bottom of my heart.
I do not wish to make this page a list of names. I'm confident who is reading knows her/his own name and I look forward to thank you in person.  I feel nonetheless compelled to thank here the one I am no longer able to meet: nonno Carlo e nonno Vittorio, zio Papele.\\
